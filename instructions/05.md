# Exercise 5: Securing the IoT	

## Scenario

With the IoT solution roll-out, CTO is concerned about the overall security, specifically around STRIDE threats (spoofing of user identity, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, the elevation of privilege).

How can you ensure that solution is secure end to end?


## Overview

In this exercise, you will complete the following activities:

* Enable Microsoft Defender for IoT
* Create a Security Module Twin
* Install Security center Agent on a Linux Machine
* Configure monitored resources
* Create custom alerts
* Review the alert in the Azure Security Center

## Instructions

### Task 1: Enable Azure Security Center for IoT Hub

Azure Security Center for IoT enables you to unify security management and enable end-to-end threat detection and analysis across hybrid cloud workloads and your Azure IoT solution. You can learn more about Azure Security Center for IoT by following the link: ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/asc-for-iot/overview``` 

Azure Security Center for IoT offers full integration with your existing IoT device management platform, enabling you to manage your device security status as well as make use of existing device control capabilities.


In this task, you will enable **Azure Security Center for IoT** for your IoT Hub. 

1. On the resource group tile, click **iot-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and select the existing IoT Hub named **iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Defender for IoT**, click **Overview**.

    Azure Security Center for IoT Hub will onboard the first time a Security pane is opened. 

1. If the **Secure your IoT solution** button is displayed, click **Secure your IoT solution**, and then refresh your browser window when prompted.

   ![](media/iotsecurity1.png)

1. Please logout and login again to ```https://portal.azure.com``` for changes to take effect.

   > **Note**: You can ignore the warning related to insufficient permission before log out, as the permission will be propagated when you log in again.

1. Navigate back to IoT Hub and select **Overview** under **Defender for IoT** on the left side menu.

1. Take a moment to review the contents on the **Defender for IoT Overview** pane.

    > **Note**: Threats are not instantly detected the first moment that you onboard Azure Security Center for IoT, you will begin to see threat detections reported on this Overview pane before the end of this lab. 

#### Log Analytics creation

When Azure Security Center for IoT is turned on, a default Azure Log Analytics workspace is created to store raw security events, alerts, and recommendations for your IoT devices, IoT Edge, and IoT Hub.

A Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment for Azure Monitor log data. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration, and data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in a particular workspace. You need an Azure Log Analytics for Security Center to store it's data.

In this task, you will create a log analytics workspace for Azure Security Center.

1. Open the Security Overview pane for your IoT Hub.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Defender for IoT**, to show the security settings, click **Settings**. 

    The **Settings page** blade should now be open with the **Data Collection** option displayed under **Names**
    
1. Select **Data Collection** and take a minute to review the Settings information displayed.
   
     > **Note**: Notice the **Workspace configuration** that has been defined for your Log Analytics workspace. By default, turning on the Azure Security Center for IoT solution automatically secures all IoT Hubs under your Azure subscription. It may take some time to see the Log Analytics workspace.

1. If the Log Analytics workspace is not yet configured, click on the toggle button to choose the workspace and then select the existing **Workspace** under **Workspace Configuration**.

    ![](media/logworkspace1.png)

1. Once the deployment got succeeded, select the workspace you have created just now from the drop-down for **Workspace**.

1. Click **Save** to save the Data Collection Configurations.

### Task 2: Create a Security Module Twin

Device twins are JSON documents that store device state information including metadata, configurations, and conditions. Azure IoT Hub maintains a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub. For more information on the device twins see this - ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins```

Similar to device twins, module twins are JSON documents that store module state information including metadata, configurations, and conditions. Azure IoT Hub maintains a module twin for each module that you connect to IoT Hub. For more information on module twins see this - ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-module-twins```

Azure Security Center for IoT makes use of the module twin mechanism and maintains a security module twin named "azureiotsecurity" for each of your devices. The security module twin holds all the information relevant to device security for each of your devices. To make full use of Azure Security Center for IoT features, you will need to create, configure, and use these security module twins for your new IoT Edge device.

The security module twin holds all the information relevant to device security for each of your devices.

The security module twin (**azureiotsecurity**) can be created by using either of the following methods:

* Use the Module batch script (```https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-Security/tree/master/security_module_twin```). This script automatically creates a module twin for new devices (or devices without a module twin) using the default configuration.

* Manually edit each module twin individually with specific configurations for each device.

In this task, you will be creating a security module twin manually.

1. Navigate to your resource group tile, click **iot-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and select IoT Hub named **iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. From the left-side menu, click **Devices** under **Device management**.

1. Under **DEVICE ID**, click **turbine-01**.

1. On the **turbine-01** blade, near the top of the blade, click **+ Add Module Identity**.

1. On the **Add Module Identity** pane, under **Module Identity Name**, enter **azureiotsecurity**

    You will be using Symmetric Keys for authentication, so you can leave all over fields at their defaults.

1. At the bottom of the pane, click **Save**.

1. On the **turbine-01** blade, under **Module Identities**, you should now see your **azureiotsecurity** device listed.

    Notice that the connection state is **Disconnected**.
    
    ![](media/disconnected.png)

    > **IMPORTANT**: The Module Identity must be called **azureiotsecurity** and not another unique name.

1. On the **turbine-01** blade, to the right of **Primary Key**, click **Copy**, and then save the value in notepad for later use.

    > **Note**: Make sure to copy the device's **Primary Key** and not the connection string.

    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Security Module](media/module-identity05.png)

### Task 3: Deploy Azure Security Center for IoT Security Agent

Azure Security Center for IoT security agents collect data from IoT devices and perform security actions to mitigate the detected vulnerabilities. Security agent configuration is controllable using a set of module twin properties you can customize. In general, secondary updates to these properties are infrequent.

There are C and C# based agents. Every Azure Security Center for IoT security agent flavor offers the same set of features and supports similar configuration options.

C agents are recommended for devices with more restricted or minimal device resources.

In this task, you will be deploying a security agent to your simulated device. 

#### Logging into Linux VM

1. On the Azure portal toolbar, click **Cloud Shell**.![](media/cloudshell01.png)

    > **Note**: Ensure that the **Bash** environment is selected within the Cloud Shell.

1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt, enter **ssh demouser@<inject key="LinuxVMIP" style="color:IndianRed" enableCopy="true"/>** command, and then press **Enter**.

1. When prompted with **Are you sure you want to continue connecting?**, type **yes** and then press **Enter**.

    This prompt is a security confirmation since the certificate used to secure the connection to the VM is self-signed. The answer to this prompt will be remembered for subsequent connections and is only prompted on the first connection.

    > **Note**: You might not see the above prompt in your lab environment. Please continue to the next step. 

1. When prompted to enter the password, enter **Password.1!!**.

    Notice that, once connected, the terminal command prompt will change to show the name of the Linux VM, similar to the following.

    > demouser@linuxagentvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>:~$

    This helps you to keep track of which VM you are connected to and the current user.

#### Add Symmetric Keys to your device

You can connect to your IoT Hub with the security agent. To implement the connection, you will need your device's symmetric key or certificate information.

In this lab, you will be using the symmetric key as authentication and will need to store it in a temporary text document on the device.

1. Verify that you have the **Primary key** value for your **turbine-01** IoT device is available.

   > **Note**: Copy the Primary key value which you have saved in notepad earlier in Task 2.8. If you did not save it there please follow the steps to get the primary key:

    1. Navigate to the resource group and select the IoT Hub named **iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    1. On the left-side menu, under **Explorers**, click **IoT devices**.
    1. Under **DEVICE ID**, click **turbine-01**.
    1. From the list of details, copy your **Primary Key**.
 
1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    echo "<primary_key>" > s.key
    ```

    This command will create a device Authentication type file with your **turbine-01** device's **Primary Key**.

    > **Note**: To check if you added the correct Primary key into the file, open your file with `nano s.key` command. Check to see your device's **Primary Key** is in the file. To exit the nano editor, holding `Ctrl` and `X`. Save the file by holding `shift` and `Y`. Then hit enter.

#### Installing Security Agent

1. Ensure that the Cloud Shell session is still connected to your VM via SSH.

1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt and then run the following command: 

    ```
    cd /var/ASCIoTAgent     
    sudo ./InstallSecurityAgent.sh -i -aui Device -aum SymmetricKey -f /home/demouser/s.key -hn iothub-"SUFFIX".azure-devices.net -di turbine-01
    ```
      
    > **IMPORTANT**:
    > Ensure you use the full IoT Hub host name - i.e. **iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>.azure-devices.net** for the `-hn` switch value or just replace th e SUFFIX with <inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> .
    > Use pwd command to find the file location.

1. Type **y** and click enter when prompted to ask permission to reboot the VM for security agent installation.

    This script performs the following function:

    * Installs prerequisites.
    * Adds a service user (with interactive sign in disabled).
    * Installs the agent as a Daemon - assumes the device uses **systemd** for service management.
    * Configures **sudo users** to allow the agent to do certain tasks as root.
    * Configures the agent with the authentication parameters provided.

1. Observe the progress of the command by watching output in the Cloud Shell terminal.
   
1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt, to check the deployment status of the Azure Security Center for IoT Agent, enter the following command. 

   > **Note**: Ensure that the Cloud Shell session is still connected to your VM via SSH or else run **ssh demouser@<inject key="LinuxVMIP" style="color:IndianRed" enableCopy="true"/>**

    ```cmd/sh
    systemctl status ASCIoTAgent.service
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ![](media/linux.png)

    Specifically, you should verify that the service is **Loaded: loaded** and **Active: active (running)**. If the status is not running, you can run the command "sudo reboot " to restart the Virtual Machine and connect back to the VM and check if the service is Active.

1. On the resource group tile, navigate to **iot-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and select the existing IoT Hub named **iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

    Open your IoT Hub blade, on the navigation menu under **Device managment**, click **Devices**, and then click **turbine-01**.

1. Under **Module Identities**, notice that your **azureiotsecurity** module is now in a **Connected** state.

    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Security Module Connected](media/azuresecurity.png)

Now that your Azure Security Center for IoT device agents are installed on your device, the agents will be able to collect, aggregate, and analyze raw security events from your device.

### Task 4: Configure Azure Security Center for IoT

With Azure Security Center for IoT, you can monitor your entire IoT solution in one dashboard, surfacing all of your IoT devices, IoT platforms, and back-end resources in Azure.

Once enabled on your IoT Hub, Azure Security Center for IoT automatically identifies other Azure services, also connected to your IoT Hub and related to your IoT solution.

In addition to automatic relationship detection, you can also pick and choose which other Azure resource groups to tag as part of your IoT solution. Your selections allow you to add entire subscriptions, resource groups, or single resources.

#### Open IoT Hub

1. In your browser, open the Azure Portal and navigate to your IoT Hub.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Defender for IoT**, click **Settings**.

1. From the **Settings Page** , select **Monitored Resources** under **Names**

1. At the top of the pane, click **Edit**.

    The **Solution Management** pane opens, where you can connect additional Azure resources to your security solution by selecting their own resource groups.

1. Under **Subscriptions**, select the subscription you have access to.

1. In the **Resource groups** dropdown, click **iot-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. At the bottom of the **Solution Management** pane, click **Apply**.

    If the **Apply** button is not available, don't worry, the resources were already added.

1. Close the **Solution Management** pane and **Resources** blade and navigate back to IoT Hub overview page.

After defining all of the resource relationships, Azure Security Center for IoT leverages Azure Security Center to provide you security recommendations and alerts for these resources.

#### View Azure Security Center for IoT in Action

You now have your security agent installed on your device and your solution configured. It is a good time to check out the different views for Azure Security Center for IoT.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Defender for IoT**, click **Overview**.

    You will see the health overview for your devices, hubs, and other resources that appear on two charts. You can see the Built-in real-time monitoring, recommendations, and alerts that were enabled right when you turn on your Azure IoT Security Center.

    The image below shows the dashboard status once the security evaluation has been performed.
    
    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Security Module](media/LAB_AK_05-security-dashboard.png)

    > **IMPORTANT**:
    > The process that evaluates the security configuration of your IoT resources may take up to 24 hours to run, therefore the initial status displayed on the dashboard does not reflect the actual state of your resources. 
    
### Task 5: Introduce custom alerts

Custom security groups and alerts can be used to take full advantage of the end-to-end security information and categorical device knowledge across your full IoT solution. This will help you to provide better security for your solution. 

Azure Security Center for IoT allows you to translate this understanding into a device behavior policy and alert on any deviation from expected, normal behavior.

#### Customize an alert

As mentioned above, customers that understand the specific desired behavior of their solution can configure custom alerts that trigger when the desired behavior is exceeded. In this exercise, you will create a custom alert that monitors **Device to Cloud** messages sent via the **MQTT** protocol.

1. Open **IoT Simulator App** and start sending telemetry data for devices.

1. On your Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Hub blade.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Defender for IoT**, click **Settings**.

1. From the **Settings Page** pane appeared, select **Custom Alerts** under **Names**

1. Take a moment to examine the **Custom Alerts** pane.

    At first glance, it may appear that this pane is empty, but the item listed under **Name** is actually the **default** security group, which is created for you automatically.

    Security groups enable you to define logical groups of devices and manage their security state in a centralized way. These groups can represent devices with specific hardware, devices deployed in a certain location, or any other group suitable to your specific needs.

1. To add a custom alert to the default security group, click **default**.

    The **Device Security Group** blade lists all active custom alerts. Since this is the first time you have visited this blade, it will be empty.

1. At the top of the blade, click **Create custom alert rule**.

    The **Create custom alert rule** pane will open. Notice that the **Device Security Group** field is populated with the **default** group.

1. In the **Custom Alert** dropdown, click **Number of device to cloud messages (MQTT protocol) is not in allowed range**.

    > **Tip**:
    > Review the many custom alerts available. Consider how they can be used to secure your solution.

    > **Note**:
    > The **Description** and **Required Properties** will change depending upon the **Custom Alert** that is chosen.

1. Under **Maximal Threshold**, enter **5**.

    This satisfies the expectation that no more than five messages should be sent in a 5 minute period.
    
1. Under **Required Properties**, in the **Minimal Threshold** field, enter **1**.

    This satisfies the expectation that at least one message should be sent in a 5 minute period.

1. In the **Time Window Size** dropdown, click **00:05:00**.

1. At the bottom of the **Create custom alert rule** pane, click **OK**.

1. At the top of the **default** (Device Security Group) blade, click **Save**.

    Without saving the new alert, the alert is deleted the next time you close IoT Hub. You will be returned to the list of custom alerts. 
    
### Task 6: IoT Device with Device Twin

#### Configuring the IoT Device with Device Twin

*Device twins* are JSON documents that store device state information including metadata, configurations, and conditions. Azure IoT Hub maintains a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub.

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect.

1. On your Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Hub blade.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Device management**, click **Devices**.

1. At the top of the **Devices** pane, click  **turbine-01**

1. To display the device twin, click **Device Twin**.

    The existing device twin JSON will be displayed and will be similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
        "deviceId": "turbine-01",
        "etag": "AAAAAAAAAAE=",
        "deviceEtag": "Mjg2NzY5NzAw",
        "status": "enabled",
        "statusUpdateTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "connectionState": "Disconnected",
        "lastActivityTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "cloudToDeviceMessageCount": 0,
        "authenticationType": "sas",
        "x509Thumbprint": {
            "primaryThumbprint": null,
            "secondaryThumbprint": null
        },
        "version": 2,
        "tags": {
            "SecurityGroup": "default"
        },
        "properties": {
            "desired": {
                "$metadata": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2020-06-11T13:09:38.4712899Z"
                },
                "$version": 1
            },
            "reported": {
                "$metadata": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2020-06-11T13:09:38.4712899Z"
                },
                "$version": 1
            }
        },
        "capabilities": {
            "iotEdge": false
        }
    }
    ```

1. To add the device to the **default** security group, insert the following JSON between the **version** and **properties** fields:

    ```json
    "tags": {
        "SecurityGroup": "default"
    },
    ```

    The resultant JSON will be similar to:

    ```json
    {
        "deviceId": "turbine-01",
        "etag": "AAAAAAAAAAE=",
        "deviceEtag": "Mjg2NzY5NzAw",
        "status": "enabled",
        "statusUpdateTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "connectionState": "Disconnected",
        "lastActivityTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "cloudToDeviceMessageCount": 0,
        "authenticationType": "sas",
        "x509Thumbprint": {
            "primaryThumbprint": null,
            "secondaryThumbprint": null
        },
        "version": 2,
        "tags": {
            "SecurityGroup": "default"
        },
        "properties": {
            "desired": {
                "$metadata": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2020-06-11T13:09:38.4712899Z"
                },
                "$version": 1
            },
            "reported": {
                "$metadata": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2020-06-11T13:09:38.4712899Z"
                },
                "$version": 1
            }
        },
        "capabilities": {
            "iotEdge": false
        }
    }
    ```

1. To apply the updated JSON, click **Save**.

1. Close the **Device Twin** pane and minimize the Azure portal.

1. Open the **IoT Simulator App** and start sending telemetry data by clicking the **Send Telemetry** button.

### Task 7: Review Security Center Alerts

At this point, your console app will have sent enough telemetry to trigger the Custom Alert created earlier. 

> **Note**: The alert was set up to trigger if less than 1 and more than 5 messages where sent from a device to the cloud within a 5 minute time window.

#### Review the Security Center Dashboard

1. On your Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Hub blade.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Defender for IoT**, click **Overview**.

    Take a look at the **Threat detection** section. You should see one or more alerts displayed in the **Device security alerts** chart:

    ![Device security alert chart](media/LAB_AK_05-device-security-alert-chart.png)

    You should also see an entry for the **turbine01** device in the **Devices with the most alerts** tile:

    > **Note**: It can take between 15 and 20 minutes for alerts to be displayed on the dashboard.

1. Under **Threat detection**, click the **Devices with the most alerts** tile.

    This will open the same **Alerts** blade as you would see if you were to click **Security Alerts** under **Defender for IoT** on the left-side menu.

    You will see a list of Security Alerts:

    ![Security Alert List](media/device_security_alert.png)

    The latest alerts will be marked with a **NEW** label.

1. Minimize the Azure Portal and open the **IoT Simulator App**.

1. Stop sending Telemetry data by clicking the button **Stop Telemetry**.


In this exercise, you learned how to secure your IoT Solution. This concludes the lab.
